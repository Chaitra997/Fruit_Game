# Gesture-Based Fruit Catching Game


This game uses computer vision to track hand gestures for controlling the player character that catches falling fruits.

### What I Did:
- Used **OpenCV** and **Mediapipe** to detect real-time hand gestures.
- Programmed fruit generation and movement logic.
- Created gesture-to-action mappings (e.g., hand moves = basket moves).
- Built score tracking and visual feedback overlays for game interaction.
